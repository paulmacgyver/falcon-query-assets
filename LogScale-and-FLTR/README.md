# Welcome

Welcome to the LogScale space of the Falcon Query Assets repo, formerly known as Humio. Here we'll include useful queries, dashboards, tutorials, etc for LogScale. These are not meant as replacements for the [official documentation](https://library.humio.com) or the [LogScale Package Marketplace](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/packages-marketplace.html). The majority of the content has been developed by the CrowdStrike SE team. 

# Content

Here's a quick summary of the various folders in this repo:

- **Alerts**: these are custom alerts that can be leveraged in LogScale.

- **Dashboards**: dashboards that can be imported ad-hoc. 

- **Lookup Files**: CSVs that can be used with the [match function](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/functions-match.html).

- **Packages**: :warning: unofficial packages :warning: used by the SE team. These are primarily meant as learning examples. This is not a replacement for the [LogScale Package Marketplace](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/packages-marketplace.html).
